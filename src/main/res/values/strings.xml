    <string name="pref_help_topdomain">The dns traffic will be sent as queries for subdomains under _topdomain_. This is
        normally a subdomain to a domain you own. Use a short domain name to get better throughput. If nameserver is the
        iodined server, then the topdomain can be chosen freely. This argument must be the same on both the client and
        the server.
    </string>
    <string name="pref_help_lazy">Use lazy mode for improved performance and decreased latency. A very small minority of
        DNS relays appears to be unable to handle the lazy mode traffic pattern, resulting in no or very little data
        coming through. The iodine client will detect this and try to switch back to legacy mode, but this may not
        always work. In these situations use this switch.
    </string>
    <string name="pref_help_raw">If set used, iodine will try getting the public IP address of the iodined host and test
        if it is reachable directly. If it is, traffic will be sent to the server instead of the DNS relay.
    </string>
    <string name="pref_help_tunnel_nameserver">The nameserver to use to relay the dns traffic. This can be any relaying
        nameserver or the server running iodined if reachable. This field can be given as an IP address, or as a
        hostname. This argument is optional, and if not specified the default system Nameserver will be used.

    <string name="pref_help_nameserver">Custom Nameserver IP-Address to set if Nameserver-mode is "Custom"</string>
    <string name="pref_help_request_type">DNS request type override. By default, autodetection will probe for working
        DNS request types, and will select the request type that is expected to provide the most bandwidth. However, it
        may turn out that a DNS relay imposes limits that skew the picture, which may lead to an "unexpected" DNS
        request type providing more bandwidth. In that case, use this option to override the autodetection. In
        (expected) decreasing bandwidth order, the supported DNS request types are: NULL, TXT, SRV, MX, CNAME and A
        (returning CNAME). Note that SRV, MX and A may/will cause additional lookups by "smart" caching nameservers to
        get an actual IP address, which may either slow down or fail completely.
    </string>
    <string name="pref_help_request_encoding">Force downstream encoding type for all query type responses except
        NULL. Default is autodetected, but may not spot all problems for the more advanced codecs. Use this option to
        override the autodetection. Base32 is the lowest-grade codec and should always work; this is used when
        autodetection fails. Base64 provides more bandwidth, but may not work on all nameservers. Base64u is equal to
        Base64 except in using underscore (\'_\') instead of plus sign (\'+\'), possibly working where Base64 does not.
        Base128 uses high byte values (mostly accented letters in iso8859-1), which might work with some nameservers.
        For TXT queries, Raw will provide maximum performance, but this will only work if the nameserver path is fully
        8-bit-clean for responses that are assumed to be "legible text".
    </string>
    <string name="pref_request_hostname_size">Maximum size of upstream hostnames. Valid values are from 100 to 255.
        Default is 255. Decrease if you find some DNS relays answer to full-length queries unreliably giving widely
        varying results of fragment size autoprobe.

    <string name="pref_response_fragment_size">Response fragment size. Autoprobed when set to 0 which is a default.
